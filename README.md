##Deman##

This theme integrates elements of Google's Material Design with Wordpress using the [Material CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/). The underlying file structure, bower and gulp support is indebted to Jeremy Englert's excellent [JointsWP](http://www.jointswp.com), although Deman itself does not use any Foundation elements.

The theme takes is name from Paul Deman, winner of the 1913 Ronde van Vlaanderen.
